    Breakout Remake

    Author: Colton Ogden
    cogden@cs50.harvard.edu

    Originally developed by Atari in 1976. An effective evolution of
    Pong, Breakout ditched the two-player mechanic in favor of a single-
    player game where the player, still controlling a paddle, was tasked
    with eliminating a screen full of differently placed bricks of varying
    values by deflecting a ball back at them.

    This version is built to more closely resemble the NES than
    the original Pong machines or the Atari 2600 in terms of
    resolution, though in widescreen (16:9) so it looks nicer on 
    modern systems.
