The player will play the game in any cases that they want to take a break from work or life. They could be anywhere that the game can be run; either on a laptop or desktop.

### 2.2 Domain Model with Description

### 2.3 Product Functions (general)  
To keep our game simple and easy to use we have decided to implement very basic functionality. Our game will include a viewing state that contains the fish and decorations the player has in their tank. There will also be a shop where the player can spend the coins they earn from their aquarium to buy new fish, decorations, and tanks. Minigames will be available for the user to play where they can earn rewards and other items that will help them build their aquarium. The key element that makes our game an idle game, is that the player can still earn money even while they are not playing. This will allow the player to still progress while being free to do other things and not focus solely on the game.
