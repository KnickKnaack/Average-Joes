# Problem Statement


## Our Mission:
We are AverageJoes and creating a fun and relaxing Idle game, Idle Aquarium! This is indented for people to distract themselves from the harder part of actually living! This will be in the lua language under the open source framework LOVE. The main concept of our game is to allow players to start out with an empty tank or ocean environment, and be able to collect, breed, and cherish fish of all shapes, sizes, colors and species. As they collect these Fish, they will earn a currency which can then be used to buy more fish and special decorations to make their environment look nice and pretty. All of these will be flushed out in detail in the sections below.


## Viewing Area:
After purchasing fish, decorations, and backgrounds from the shop, The player can come back to the viewing area to watch their fish swim around and earn coins in the environment they created! The decorations, backgrounds, and fish that the player owns can be placed in this area. If the player no longer wants an item placed, then they can place it in an inventory for use another time. From this screen, players will be able to access the shop and the minigame menus so they can spend/earn more coins!


## Currency:
One key element of our game that we plan to implement is a currency system. The main way the player will earn money is based on people coming to view their aquarium, the more people that come to visit the aquarium, the more money the player will earn. To increase the number of views the aquarium gets, the player can obtain better fish, better decorations, and better environments. Each item will have a currency per minute value which will increase as the items get better and better. This will be the way that the player can earn the main currency in the game, however there will also be another special type of currency. This special currency will be earned through completing minigames and special events. The player can then use this currency to obtain special items that could not be obtained by using the normal currency.


## MiniGames:
For our game we will have some mini games added in. The purpose of the mini games is to help keep user frustration at a low as well as increase playability through a reward system. For the actual mini games themselves they will be basic and not require too much effort from the user, this is by the design so the user can have a different way to play than just playing idly. They can also unlock backgrounds as well as other fish to customize the look of their personal aquarium and give them a reason to keep playing. In addition daily bonuses and challenges will be added for encouragement to keep returning and logging in to the game. The few mini games we do have planned out so far that we know for sure we are going to include are an escape mine game, where a giant predator is chasing you down. Another one is the screen will flood with fish and you must select or find a specific fish.


## Shop:
The shop is where players can use the currencies they earned throughout the game. In here players can buy new fish breeds, decorations, fish food and backgrounds. To keep things fresh and give a reason for the players to look into the shop, we also include a special offers page. The special offers will present a certain amount of items or fish breeds everyday with special discount. Itâ€™s a good way to get expensive items and breeds for a reasonable price.  
The shop will have 6 sections:
* Fish
* Decoration
* Food
* Background
* Special offers: using special currency to buy exclusive types of fish and decoration.
* Mystery box: a gacha section where players can gamble with special currency for special rewards.
