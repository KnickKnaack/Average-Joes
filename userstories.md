### 1: Have multiple tanks to contain fish
As a try hard player, I would love to be able to have multiple fish tanks at a time to hold a more variety of fish.

Elaboration: User should be able to have multiple tanks where they can keep their fish simultaneously. This would also means that there will be an increase in income. It is reasonable because the prices for resources are exponential. Moreover, having multiple fish tanks will make the game looks fresher and it is what players like me would love to experience.

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 6 person-hours

Acceptance Test:
* Make multiple tanks available at the same time but only displaying one at a time.
* User must be able to move between tanks by the arrows at the bottom of the screen.
* Set the maximum amount of tanks a player can own.
* Test the arrow buttons, test the currencies generated in each tank.

### 2: Have different fish
As a user, I want to have different fish available to use so there is variety in the tank.

Elaboration: Users should be able to obtain new and different fish through means of breeding or purchasing them to add new fish in their aquarium.

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 6 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Perform tests on breeding that show that different fish can be obtained through different breeding combinations. Perform tests that the user can purchase new fish in the shop.

### 3: Be able to pass the time
As someone with a lot of free time, I want an interactive game so that I can pass the time.

Elaboration: The game should include several minigames that the user can play to obtain currency and items. The minigames will give the player something to do beside just sitting and waiting for the aquarium to generate money.

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 10 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Develop and test different minigames and ensure they are entertaining and functional with no major bugs that will make the game unplayable.

### 4: Quick Access
As a full time student I want to be able to quickly check and progress the state of my game so that I can spend more time studying for my courses.

Elaboration: Users should be able to spend minimal time on the functions of our game. Since this app is an Idle game, users will spend small amounts of time checking in on their game state, and making this time quicker will allow users to play the game when they have a minute or two. 

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 1 person-hour

Acceptance Test: Select random volunteers to mimic a “check in” on their game and make sure that the time is less than 2 min.

### 5: Accurate Fish Depictions
As a marine biologist I want the fish to accurately represent the species they claim to be so that I don’t have to be distracted by these misjudgments while I play the game.

Elaboration: Unless there are made up species that have no coorelation to species of fish on our world, all fish should accurately represent the fish that we claim them to be through their art sprite and/or behaviour.

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 2 person-hours

Acceptance Test: For every Fish that is based on a real fish, ask volunteers if they believe the sprite accurately resembles the fish.

### 6: Have one free to choose item in Special Offers
As a busy mom that can only get to play a few days a week, I would love to have the ability to choose which item that can show up in special offer so that I do not miss them on the day I cannot logon to the game.

Elaboration: User should be able to choose one item slot in the special offer section. Not everyone is available to play every day to catch every special offer. So adding one free choice will help players like me get their desire fish or item without having to logon every day.

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 3 person-hours

Acceptance Test: The one choice players can make definitely help with getting the item they want but it should only happen once a week. Instead of randomizing one item for each slot in the special offers section, we can make one that shows a variety of items to choose from. Test the list generator, test the price display, and test the date for the freedom of choice item to show up.
