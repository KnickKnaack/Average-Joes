# User Stories

### 1: Have multiple tanks to contain fish
As a try hard player, I would love to be able to have multiple fish tanks at a time to hold a more variety of fish.

Elaboration: User should be able to have multiple tanks where they can keep their fish simultaneously. This would also mean that there will be an increase in income. It is reasonable because the prices for resources are exponential. Moreover, having multiple fish tanks will make the game look and feel fresher and it is what players like me would love to experience.

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 6 person-hours

Acceptance Test:
* Make multiple tanks available at the same time but only displaying one at a time.
* User must be able to move between tanks by the arrows at the bottom of the screen.
* Set the maximum amount of tanks a player can own.
* Test the arrow buttons, test the currencies generated in each tank.

### 2: Have different fish
As a user, I want to have different fish available to use so there is large variety of different kinds of fish in the tank.

Elaboration: Users should be able to obtain new and different fish through means of breeding or purchasing them to add new fish in their personal aquarium(s).

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 6 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Perform tests on breeding that show that different fish can be obtained through different breeding combinations. Will need to establish a functioning breeding system that may be accessible by the user. Then, perform tests if the user can navigate to the breeding screen and breed two of their own fish successfully. The user must also be able to purchase a new breed of fish with currency collected over time of play from in the store's purchasing system. Perform tests if the user can purchase new fish in the shop.

### 3: Be able to pass the time
As someone with a lot of free time, I want an interactive game so that I can pass the time.

Elaboration: The game should include several minigames that the user can play to obtain currency and items. The minigames will give the player something to do beside just sitting and waiting for the aquarium to generate money. This is to achieve the goal of playability.

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 10 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Develop and test different minigames and ensure they are entertaining and functional with no major bugs that will make the game unplayable.

### 4: Quick Access
As a full time student I want to be able to quickly check and progress the state of my game so that I can spend more time studying for my courses.

Elaboration: Users should be able to spend minimal time on the functions of our game. Since this app is an idle game, users will spend small amounts of time checking in on their game state, and making this time quicker will allow users to play the game when they have a minute or two.

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 1 person-hour

Acceptance Test: Select random volunteers to mimic a “check in” on their game and make sure that the time is less than 2 min.

### 5: Accurate Fish Depictions
As a marine biologist I want the fish to accurately represent the species they claim to be so that I don’t have to be distracted by these misjudgments while I play the game.

Elaboration: Unless there are made up species that have no correlation to species of fish on our world, all fish should accurately represent the fish that we claim them to be through their art sprite and/or behavior.

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 2 person-hours

Acceptance Test: For every Fish that is based on a real fish, ask volunteers if they believe the sprite accurately resembles the fish.

### 6: Have one free to choose item in Special Offers
As a busy mom that can only get to play a few days a week, I would love to have the ability to choose which item that can show up in special offer so that I do not miss them on the day I cannot log on to the game.

Elaboration: User should be able to choose one item slot in the special offer section. Not everyone is available to play every day to catch every special offer. So adding one free choice will help players like me get their desire fish or item without having to logon every day.

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 3 person-hours

Acceptance Test: The one choice players can make definitely help with getting the item they want but it should only happen once a week. Instead of randomizing one item for each slot in the special offers section, we can make one that shows a variety of items to choose from. Test the list generator, test the price display, and test the date for the freedom of choice item to show up.

### 7: Suitable for Younger Audiences
As a father I sometimes give my younger child my tablet or phone to play with. I would like the peace of mind of knowing this game is suitable for them to play if they choose to access it.

Elaboration: A user of any age should be able to play our game with no adult content or mature material.

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 1 person-hours

Acceptance Test: After completion of game, tester will thoroughly navigate through each and every menu, as well as allowing the game to idly play, and make sure this game is suitable for play by all age groups. This Will be achieved through use of positive and non mature game/menu music as well as realistic positive fish and backgrounds. Mini games and play will also be suitable for all ages and exclude any mature material.

### 8: More Prizes for Events
As a complete F2P player that needs to save up my resources to get the items I desire, I would love to have rewards from mini game outside from just gems.

Elaboration: User would be able to acquire a random species of fish from different rarities depending on the difficulty of the events.

Constraints: none

Effort Estimation: 1 person-hours

Acceptance Test: A randomizer for the winning prize. Prizes display state.

### 9: Interaction With Game
When I play this idle game I want to be able to interact with it as well. I understand that an idle game usually is played in an "idle" state, where you just let it sit and as time progresses you earn or complete rewards. But with this game I would also like to be able to tap on the fish to speed up my coin collection speed, giving me more interaction with the game.

Elaboration: User would like to have touch/mouse input for interacting with the game.

Constraints: Mouse click or button press as well as touch input must be accepted.

Effort Estimation: 2 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Touch input as well as a mouse click will be read and accepted then return some kind of visual feedback to user. Feedback could also include audio as well as some kind of animation.

### 10: Requires little thought
As someone who works full time, I want to be able to come home and turn off my brain for a while with a simple game. It would be nice to play a game that requires little effort so I can get away for a while.

Elaboration: The game should be simple to use and not require a large amount of effort from the user.

Constraints: None

Effort Estimation: 5 person-hours

Acceptance Test: Once a working game is developed, we will provide a beta version to game testers to ensure the game functions and mechanics are simple, as well as easy to pick up by someone who has never seen the game before.
